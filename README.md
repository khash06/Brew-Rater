# Brew-Rater
Application created using React, GraphQL, and MongoDB to rate and comment on beers. User can add new beers with name, type, abv, comment, rating, and brewery. The page will also show beers from the same brewery, if any exist in the database. If the user wants to input a new brewery, there is a separate form that will input the brewery into the drop-down. Brewery details include city, state, and country. 

## Built With
* React - front-end framework
* GraphQL - query language

* Mongoose - object data modelling library for MongoDB
* MongoDB - NoSQL database
